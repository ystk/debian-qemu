    9pfs: local: set the path of the export root to "."
    
    The local backend was recently converted to using "at*()" syscalls in order
    to ensure all accesses happen below the shared directory. This requires that
    we only pass relative paths, otherwise the dirfd argument to the "at*()"
    syscalls is ignored and the path is treated as an absolute path in the host.
    This is actually the case for paths in all fids, with the notable exception
    of the root fid, whose path is "/". This causes the following backend ops to
    act on the "/" directory of the host instead of the virtfs shared directory
    when the export root is involved:
    - lstat
    - chmod
    - chown
    - utimensat
    
    ie, chmod /9p_mount_point in the guest will be converted to chmod / in the
    host for example. This could cause security issues with a privileged QEMU.
    
    All "*at()" syscalls are being passed an open file descriptor. In the case
    of the export root, this file descriptor points to the path in the host that
    was passed to -fsdev.
    
    The fix is thus as simple as changing the path of the export root fid to be
    "." instead of "/".
    
    This is CVE-2017-7471.
